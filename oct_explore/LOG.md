# oct_explore log (times CST)

Problem: random 4-SAT, r=9.93, m=round(9.93n), 4 distinct vars, random signs (F-sat generator of
noiseless/sat4_poisson_run.py), all satisfiable instances kept, success p = Born prob on all E=0 strings.
Seeds: train 3.1e10+1e7n+k (100 inst at n=8), test 3.2e10+1e7n+k (100 at n=8,10,12,20; 200 at n=14).
Metric: median and 90th percentile (B90) of 1/p over test instances. Random guess = 2^n/#solutions.
Code: `sim.py` (JAX simulator), `train.py` (train n=8 with layer growth, freeze, test), `qaoa_ref.py` (QAOA reference), `report.py`.

Circuit: registers = (transmon, cavity) pairs, no coupling between them. Per layer, parameters SHARED by all
cavities (so the same vector runs on 2 or 3 cavities): transmon R(theta,phi) -> ECD(beta_c) with
beta_c=(bre+i bim)*sqrt(2^k_c) -> exp(-i gamma C(x)) on the joint computational space.
'raw' cost C = E*n/m (density-normalised clause count), 'std' C = (E-mean)/std. Gray-coded Fock levels.
Start: uniform superposition over the computational space (QAOA analogue; vacuum start tested separately).
Cavity truncation 2^k + max(8, 2^k/4) levels; checked: padding to +64 changes median 1/p by <1e-5 (n=8, 14).
Training: L-BFGS on exact JAX gradients, L = 1,2,3,4,6,8 grown from the previous L (+ interpolated + random restarts).

## Exp 0 (17:40): objective = mean p (as specified) -> degenerate
Mean-p training makes the circuit dump all probability on instances where it is easy: train mean p rises
(0.11 at L=8) but median 1/p ~ 1e5-1e10 (half the instances get p~0). Unusable for median/B90. Switched to
the mean of log p (geometric mean), which is what the median metric rewards. Results kept in results/meanp_obj/.

## Step 0 + Step A (17:46-18:11): logp objective
Median / B90 of 1/p, params trained at n=8 only, frozen:

| SATLike (F-sat) | - | 16/70 | 26/111 | 36/157 | 50/208 | ~124/~530 (fit) |

Findings:
- Step 0: transmon-bit layout is NOT clearly worse than cavity-only (n=8 L=8 17 vs 14; n=12 258 vs 361).
  Keep the transmon-bit layout (n=20 fits under the 6-bit cap).
- raw vs std cost normalisation: no meaningful difference.
- Transfer loss is small: training directly at n=14 (40 inst) gives L=2 median 1541 vs 1704 transferred.
  So the problem is not transfer, it is expressivity of the ECD mixer.
- The ECD circuit is much weaker than QAOA: ~10x at n=8 L=8, 40x at n=14, ~3000x at n=20 (near random).
- Trained displacements are tiny (|b|~0.05); the optimiser mostly uses the transmon rotations, i.e. it mixes
  the transmon bits and barely the cavity bits. Displacement hops n<->n+1 with amplitude ~beta*sqrt(n): very
  inhomogeneous across Fock levels and not a Hamming-local bit-flip mixer, so the cavity bits are poorly explored.
  The more bits sit in cavities (n=20: 17/20), the closer to random.

## Next (18:12): mixer expressivity probes at n=8 -> 12,14 (L=1,2,4,6)
E_bin (binary code), E_vac (vacuum start), E_snap2 (per-layer size-free cavity SNAP phase
phi(n)=s1 u + s2 u^2, u=n/sqrt(2^k), part of the allowed arbitrary diagonal, instance independent).
